*Only analyze packets from or to 128.119.240.84, only expand needed info when export

1. Examine the first TLS client hello packet and answer
Client Hello: <packet number> - <TLS version> - <First two hexadecimal of random bytes>

2. How many cipher suites are supported by client? Which one has been chosen by server? Export related packets to Cipher.txt
Cipher: <suite number> - <chosen cipher suite in hexadecimal>

3.1. What is the locality name of the certification authority that issued the certificate for id-at-commonName=www.cs.umass.edu? Export related packets to Cert.txt
Cert: *** *****

3.2. What digital signature algorithm is used by the CA to sign this certificate?
Sig: ****** With *** Encryption

3.3. What are the first four hexadecimal digits of the modulus of the public key being used by www.cs.umass.edu?
Modulus: 0x****

4. What are the first four hexadecimal digits of public key sent from client to server. Export related packets to Key.txt
Public key: 0x****

5. Does the client provide its own CA-signed public key certificate back to the server? If so export related packets to ClientCert.txt
Client certificate: yes/no

6. Export packet has the TLS message that shuts down the TLS connection to Disconnect.txt. Because TLS messages are encrypted in our Wireshark traces so weâ€™ll have to make an educated guess
